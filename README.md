# üß† Data Structures Visualizer (In Progress)

This project is a desktop-based application that helps visualize core Data Structures using **Java** and **Swing**. It is designed to support students, learners, and educators in understanding how fundamental data structures work through interactive visuals and step-by-step animations.

## üìå Features

- üìä **Binary Trees**
  - Node insertion
  - traversal (animated)

- üì¶ **Stacks & Queues** *(Planned)*
  - Push / Pop / Enqueue / Dequeue animations

- üåê **Graphs** *(Planned)*  
  - Traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)

## üéØ Project Goals

- Visual learning aid for fundamental data structures
- Strengthen understanding of DSA through coding
- Practice GUI development in **Java Swing**
- Make DSA fun and interactive for beginners
